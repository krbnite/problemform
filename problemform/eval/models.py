"""Evaluation-framework data model.

Phase A (M3A) types — ``TestCase``, ``ComparativeJudgment``, ``TestCaseResult``,
``AggregateMetrics``, ``BenchmarkReport`` — capture the answer-comparison
contract. See ``docs/designs/milestone_03_evaluation_framework.md`` for that
design.

Phase B (M3B-α) types — ``Rubric`` / ``RubricCriterion`` / ``CriterionScore`` /
``AbsoluteRubricEvaluation`` / ``RubricAggregate`` and ``PropertyCheck`` /
``PropertyCheckResult`` / ``PropertyAggregate`` — add target-aware rubric and
property-check evaluation. ``target`` is a first-class axis (``formulation`` or
``artifact``) on rubrics and property checks; only absolute mode is supported
in α (comparative mode deferred to M3B-β). See
``docs/designs/milestone_03b_rubrics_and_properties.md``.
